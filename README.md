# Starship-config
This starship configuration is pretty basic, i took as an example the [Catppuccin Powerline Preset](https://starship.rs/presets/catppuccin-powerline) directly from the Starship official website and tweaked it using ChatGPT to help me generate differente color palettes as i am awful at choosing matching colors.
The nerd font i used is the FiraCode Nerd Font from the [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) official website for icon support.
Empty brackets [ ] in the .toml file are showing an icon and will keep failing to display it until a nerd font is installed.
